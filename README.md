# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

While this project uses React, Vite supports many popular JS frameworks. [See all the supported frameworks](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

## Deploy Your Own
